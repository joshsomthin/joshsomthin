### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Josh!

My passion for problem solving and learning is what landed me in software engineering. In previous jobs I found myself running into a wall where I felt there was a limit to what I could learn, something I never want to feel again. Software engineering is my creative outlet where I can combine my aptitude for creative problem solving and learning, and make products that can have an impact on peoples day to day.
